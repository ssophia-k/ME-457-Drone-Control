A Python UAV simulator for ME-457. Using the textbook Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice by Randy Beard and Tim McLain (https://github.com/randybeard/mavsim_public)

The Demos folder holds example executables of the simulation at various points of progress.

The Tests folder holds textbook-provided test cases with their answer keys commented within. Some stuff, we believe at least, is wrong. But mostly correct.
