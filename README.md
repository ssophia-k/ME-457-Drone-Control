A Python UAV simulator for ME-457. Using the textbook Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice by Randy Beard and Tim McLain (https://github.com/randybeard/mavsim_public)

The Tests folder holds example executables of the simulation at various points of progress. Some stuff has textbook-provided answer keys. Others are made by us.

See Final Project for all final project codes. Implementation of optimized LQR controller exists within Controllers folder. To run this controller, use either ch6 or ch8 test cases (just change the inputted controller simulation).
